### Task: Build the n_gram model and RNN model for some applications

1. **Song attribution:** Train the **Ngram model** on the different singers' lyric datasets and test it with the test dataset. Calculating the perplexity of them to predict that the lyric is most likely to which singers' albums.

2. **Test generation:**  Train an RNN LM using `data/ed_sheeran.txt`. In this part, we use `predict_next_words()` method to generate sentences after the provided phrases from `s1` to `s3`. Use modes `max` and `multinomial`.

3. **Comparison:** **Ngram model**, **RNN**, and **GPT-2**. Train them based on the `data/bbc/tech-small.txt` dataset. Calculating the perplexity of models.
